# Basics of OS

## What is an Operating System ? 

- An operating system acts as an interface between the user of a computer and computer hardware, to provide an environment in which a user can execute programs conveniently and efficiently.
- An Operating System (OS) is a fully integrated set of specialized programs that manages computer hardware resources and controls and monitors the execution of all other programs that reside in the computer, which also includes application programs and other system software of the computer.
- The operating System comes with a large number of device drivers that make OS services reachable to the hardware environment.
- An operating system is concerned with the allocation of resources and services, such as memory, processors, devices, and information. The operating system correspondingly includes programs to manage these resources, such as a traffic controller, a scheduler, a memory management module, I/O programs, and a file system.


## Major Functions of an Operating System

- **User Interface (UI)**
  - Every operating system needs a UI for users and administrators to interact with.
    - **CLI (Command Line Interface):** The CLI, or terminal mode window, provides a text-based interface where users rely on the traditional keyboard to enter specific commands, parameters and arguments related to specific tasks.
    - **GUI (Graphical User Interface):** The GUI, or desktop, provides a visual interface based on icons and symbols where users rely on gestures delivered by human interface devices, such as touchpads, touchscreens and mouse devices.
