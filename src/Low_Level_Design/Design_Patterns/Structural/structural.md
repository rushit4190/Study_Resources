## Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

Structural patterns are mostly concerned with object composition or in other words how the entities can use each other.
They ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.
