#### **Factory Method**

- Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- Factory is an object for creating other objects â€“ formally a factory is a function or method that returns objects of a varying prototype or class.

- Use the Factory pattern in Java when the class doesn't know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects it needs to create.
- Use Factory method when a method returns one of several possible classes that share a common super class and wants to encapsulate the logic of which object to create.
